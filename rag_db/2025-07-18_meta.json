Data Science & Machine Learning: Learn about data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning algorithms using Python.\n   - Resource: \"Python for Data Science Handbook\" by Jake VanderPlas (book/online)\n   \n3. Deep Learning: Dive into deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch to build more advanced AI models.\n   - Resource: \"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow\" by Aurélien Géron (book/online)\n   \n4. Practice & Projects: Apply your knowledge by working on real-world projects or participating in online coding challenges.\n   - Resource: \"Project Euler\" (website) for math/algorithmic problems\n   - Resource: \"Kaggle\" (website) for data science competitions and datasets\n   \n5.
